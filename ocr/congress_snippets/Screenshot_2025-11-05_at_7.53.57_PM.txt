**Transcription of the Text**

The text is a conversation between two individuals, Mr. Conkling and Mr. Sargent, as they discuss the allocation of funds for the Committee on Appropriations. The conversation is presented in a series of paragraphs, with each speaker's response indented to indicate their turn in the conversation.

**Mr. Conkling's Opening Statement**

I think the Committee on Appropriations were right in reporting this amount. I trust it will not be cut down one-half, because there is no obligation on the part of the investigating committee to expend more than is absolutely necessary to carry on the investigation, and they are not likely, considering their character, to spend more because we appropriate the larger amount.

**Mr. Sargent's Response**

May I ask the Senator a question? The Senator observes that it was the judgment of the Committee on Appropriations that this sum would be necessary to do this work. May I ask him for the elements of that judgment, for the data upon which it was formed?

**Mr. Conkling's Response**

We reasoned quite largely upon the cost of similar investigations, running from $80,000 down to $3,000—of course a very large opportunity to strike an average, but this is far below the average. There are some practices which have grown up in these investigations which perhaps ought to be corrected, and which I have no doubt a vigilant chairman of a committee could correct without the necessity for legislation; but if these practices shall have become so strong that only legislation can cure them, it will not be done by cutting down the amount of the appropriation, which would seem to be a very small thing to do.

**Mr. Sargent's Response**

Is it not a good way to enable him to say that, to vote $10,000?

**Mr. Conkling's Response**

I say that, still voting the $10,000. My point is this: is that a good way to enable the chairman of the committee to make a stand against this thing of paying for a great volume as if it were written out when it has never been touched?

**Mr. Sargent's Response**

I do not think it is. I am not arguing that the appropriation of $10,000 rather than $5,000 will direct the attention of the chairman to these things; but I do think that the discussion of this matter will direct his attention to it, and he will be very apt to in-quire into the authority to pay the stenographer for reporting documents with which he has no connection, except from their being stitched in the same report; and it is the duty of the clerk of the committee, if there is a clerk to the committee, to make up such documents and append them to the report.
